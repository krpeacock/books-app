##Frontend Candidate Take Home Test
###Requirements
* Based on the mockup found in [static/mockup.psd](static/mockup.psd), generate a simple HTML page that includes a header, footer, hero image with text, and a content area.
* The content area should include a list of books based on data found in [books.json](books.json)

###Hints
* We'd like to see your UI/UX abilities - vanilla CSS/Javascript would be interesting
* However, don't shy away from using libraries if it makes sense - consider the trade-offs!
* The requirements are intentionally sparse - so the content area is your time to shine.  UI/UX, functionality, etc.

###Delivery
* Provide an archive (zip) or link to a public repo to engineering(at)cuyana.com
